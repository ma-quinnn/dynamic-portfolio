            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm <span style="color:red;">Mae ❤️</span>, also known as <strong>quinnn_</strong> in the tech community. I'm a self-taught cybersecurity enthusiast from the Philippines, currently working overseas while building the foundation of my future in technology. 
                <br><br>
                With no formal IT background or degree, I began this journey fueled by pure determination, long study nights, and hands-on practice. I’m currently focused on learning Blue Team skills like log analysis, SIEM (Splunk), and network fundamentals through platforms like TryHackMe, HackTheBox and real-world labs. 
                <br><br>
                I created this website not just to showcase my projects, but to share my growth publicly — from lash/nail technician to future cybersecurity analyst. I believe that with the right mindset, strong work ethic, and daily commitment to learning, anyone can break into tech — including me.

            <h2>📘 My Learning Journey</h2>
            <p>
                Every day, I study cybersecurity and web development through structured roadmaps — networking, Linux, SIEM, and attack simulations.
                <br><br>
                I’m focused on hands-on learning via TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and CTF platforms. I will document every step — wins, struggles, and breakthroughs — right here.
                <br><br>
                My goal is to land my first cybersecurity job based on my skills, proof-of-work, and passion — not a degree. I plan to earn certifications too, but real skills come first.
